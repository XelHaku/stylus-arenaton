## **3. Arenaton’s Key Features**  

### 3.1 **ERC20 ATON: The Foundation of Tokenomics**  

ATON serves as the primary token for the Arenaton ecosystem.  

- **Utility**:  
  - Staking on events.  
  - Receiving payouts and rewards.  
  - Earning passive income through commission sharing.  

- **Economic Model**:  
  - 1:1 pegged with ETH for stability.  
  - Minted dynamically based on user staking activity.  

### 3.2 **Event Management by Oracle Role**  

The Oracle Role is integral to Arenaton’s fair event lifecycle:  

- **Event Creation**: Oracles initialize events with a unique ID, start date, and sport.  
- **Outcome Declaration**: Oracles finalize results and trigger payouts using smart contracts.  

### 3.3 **Transparent Commission Sharing**  

Arenaton implements a fair commission-sharing model to reward token holders:  

- **2% Commission**: Deducted from all stakes.  
- **Real-Time Distribution**: Commissions are calculated using the `accumulated_commission_per_token` variable and distributed during transactions.  

### 3.4 **Gasless Transactions with Stylus SDK**  

Stylus SDK enables Arenaton to achieve unprecedented gas efficiency:  

- **Rust-Powered Execution**: Reduces transaction costs by up to 50%.  
- **Scalable Operations**: Handles high-volume betting events seamlessly.

## **4. How Arenaton Works**  

### 4.1 **Event Lifecycle Managed by Oracle**  

1. **Event Creation**:  
   - Oracles use the `add_event` function to initialize new events with parameters like event ID, start date, and sport.  

2. **Betting Phase**:  
   - Users stake ETH or ATON tokens on outcomes.  
   - Odds dynamically adjust based on total stakes.  

3. **Outcome Declaration**:  
   - Oracles close the event and declare the winner via the `close_event` function.  

4. **Payout Processing**:  
   - The Oracle triggers the `pay_event` function to distribute rewards to participants.  

### 4.2 **Dynamic Odds Calculation**  

Odds are calculated in real time based on the total pool distribution for each outcome. This ensures fairness and eliminates fixed odds manipulation.  

### 4.3 **Commission Redistribution Flow**  

1. **Collection**: A flat 2% commission is deducted from stakes.  
2. **Accumulation**: Tracked in `accumulated_commission_per_token`.  
3. **Distribution**: Commissions are distributed to ATON holders during token transactions.

## **5. Technical Architecture**  

### 5.1 **ERC20 ATON Token**  

- **Minting**: Tokens are minted when users stake ETH.  
- **Burning**: Tokens are burned when swapped back to ETH.  
- **Commission Tracking**:  
  - `accumulated_commission_per_token` stores unclaimed commissions.  
  - `claimed_commissions` ensures accurate payouts.  

### 5.2 **ArenatonEngine Smart Contract**  

- **Access Control**: Managed by the `AccessControl` module, restricting event management to Oracles.  
- **Event Lifecycle**: Handles creation, betting, outcome declaration, and payout distribution.  

### 5.3 **Stylus SDK for Gas Efficiency**  

- **Execution in Rust**: Optimized smart contracts for lower gas fees.  
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Handles high transaction volumes with minimal latency.
